# Rapido Clone Hotend

## Why this works:

Current model CHC hotends with the round ceramic heater core have a serious design flaw in them: thermistor fragility+ replacability.

By design, the thermistor on the round chcs is only held in by whatever silicone the manufacturer puts into the hole. Sometimes, they may not put enough into the hole, leaving an airgap and thus making your thermistor prone to burning out early. 

Other times, the material may not even be conductive.

The design of the parts below attempts to mimic a rapido- albeit with a V6 format.

The rapido uses a similar style of
heat block to a Bambu labs type hotend.

If you've used a TZ hotend before, this is the same concept, just with a longer, "volcano" type heat block.

The block used below presents several key advantages:

1. cost
2. dedicated thermistor wiring path
3. thermistor and heater both held in by a clip
4. large aftermarket support because of V6 architecture

Heatsink- any V6 heatsink will work, just make sure that it is compatible with your heat break. The one i used for this combo is below

V6 adapter: not mandatory if you want to use volcano nozzles, but i've found it far easier to use these and just keep regular V6 CHT nozzles on hand
